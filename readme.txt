Show a users last login date by creating a sortable column in your WordPress users list.

== Description ==
A lightweight plugin that allows you to see active users according to their last login time/date. No need to configure, simply activate When Last and you're ready to go! This adds a custom column to your WordPress users list of "Last Login" and a timestamp linked to that user. When Last also integrates with other plugins and now offers some more features.
